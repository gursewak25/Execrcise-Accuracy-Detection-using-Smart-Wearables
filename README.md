# Execrcise-Accuracy-Detection-using-Smart-Wearables

This project aims to develop a reliable solution using smart wearables to assess exercise positions by collecting data from two wearables (wrist and ankle) to track and evaluate user performance against fitness goals.

Built using RNN , SVM and Random Forest Algorithm. Also includes hyperparameter tuning via crossÂ validation. The goal of this project is to enhance the effectiveness and safety of workouts as well as contribute to advancements in wearable technology.

Tech Stack: Python, Kotlin, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras

Frameworks and IDE: Arduino, Android Studio, BLE, SQLite
